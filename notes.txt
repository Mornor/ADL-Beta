1. At first compilation: 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 16, in <module>
    tests.test_load_vgg(load_vgg, tf)
  File "/Users/celien.nanson/Projects/Self Driving Car ND/ADL-Beta/project_tests.py", line 17, in func_wrapper
    result = func(*args)
  File "/Users/celien.nanson/Projects/Self Driving Car ND/ADL-Beta/project_tests.py", line 60, in test_load_vgg
    with TmpMock(tf_module.saved_model.loader, 'load') as mock_load_model:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'saved_model'

Cause: 
	Tensorflow is not up-to date 

Solution: 
	pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow --ignore-installed

2. Comment out all the tests in `main.py` which are either way executed and prevented me to focus on a specific method. 
Re-active them once the method is built.
